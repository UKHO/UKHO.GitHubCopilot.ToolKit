# Work Package Refactoring Mitigation Plan Template

> Use this template to plan how the issues identified in a work-package refactoring review will be mitigated. Keep the plan actionable, traceable to the review findings, and aligned to the repository refactoring guidance so maintainability improves without unintended behavior changes.
>
> Review the relevant `./docs/wiki/` pages before drafting this plan so refactoring work stays aligned with the current project understanding. Include wiki updates whenever the mitigation work changes wiki-documented implementation guidance, architecture, testing guidance, local development guidance, or user-visible behavior.
>
> Keep work items execution-ready and lean. Prefer exact finding identifiers, file references, and validation commands over descriptive filler.

## Summary

- **Source review**: `<../work-package-refactoring-review-report.md>`
- **Work package**: `<./docs/00x-work/>`
- **Status**: `<draft|review|approved|in-progress|done>`
- **Inputs**:
  - `../work-package-refactoring-review-report.md`
  - `../requirements.md`
  - `../technical-specification.md`
  - existing numbered plan files in this folder (for example `001-delivery-plan.md`)

## Description of work

<Describe what this mitigation plan will change in the implementation, tests, and documentation to address the confirmed refactoring findings. Keep the scope specific to the review issues being addressed and state the intended behavior-preservation boundaries clearly.>

## Mitigation approach

- **Delivery model**: `<single PR | multiple PRs | phased refactoring>`
- **Branching**: `<strategy>`
- **Dependencies**: `<projects, services, components, infrastructure, or data needed>`
- **Behavior-preservation boundaries**:
  - `<observable behavior that must remain unchanged>`
- **Key risks**:
  - `<risk + mitigation>`

## Review findings to address

| Finding ID | Review area | Review assessment | Source evidence | Planned mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `F1` | `<FRx / area>` | Duplication / Complexity / Coupling / Boundary leakage / Weak cohesion / Testability | `<path or finding summary>` | `<what will be done>` |

## Mitigation Plan

### Execution gates (required)

Before starting *any* mitigation work item, and again before marking a work item as complete, run the build + test suite and resolve any failures.

| Gate | When | Required actions | If failures occur |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | Before starting any work item | Run build and all tests listed in **Cross-cutting validation** | Fix or revert until build/tests are green before continuing |
| Pre-completion | Before completing a work item | Re-run build and all tests listed in **Cross-cutting validation** | Fix failures before marking the work item complete |

### Planned work items

| Work item | Description | Traceability (review findings) | Traceability (requirements) | Dependencies | Validation | Rollback/Backout | User instructions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Work Item 1: `<brief title>` | `<what will be refactored or strengthened>` | `<F1, F2>` | `<FRx/NFx/SRx/TRx/...>` | `<dependencies and sequencing>` | `<build/test/verification criteria>` | `<how to revert if needed>` | `<instructions for reviewer/operator>` |

    - [ ] Step 1: [Update impacted tests, comments, or traceability notes]
    - [ ] Step 2: [Update `docs/wiki/` when behavior, architecture, local development, operator guidance, or testing approach changes]
    - [ ] Step N: [Description]
  - [ ] Build and test validation

  - **Files**:
    - `path/to/source-file.cs`: [Description of changes; include exact path and symbol or line references when known]
    - `path/to/test-file.cs`: [Description of changes; include exact path and symbol or line references when known]
    - `docs/wiki/...`: [Description of documentation changes]
  - **Work Item Dependencies**: [Dependencies and sequencing]
  - **User Instructions**: [Instructions for user/reviewer]

### Work Item N details (copy/paste)

Copy the **Work Item 1 details** section for each additional work item.

## Cross-cutting validation

- **Build**: `<command(s)>`
- **Unit tests**: `<command(s)>`
- **Integration tests**: `<command(s)>`
- **Functional tests**: `<command(s)>`
- **E2E tests**: `<command(s)>`
- **Manual checks**:
  - `<manual verification if needed>`
- **Behavior-preservation checks**:
  - `<observable behavior, API, UI, or configuration checks>`
- **Security checks**:
  - `<identity or access-control safety, secret handling, dependency lifetime checks, or similar checks>`

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Every planned mitigation maps back to one or more findings in `work-package-refactoring-review-report.md`.
- [ ] High-priority maintainability and change-safety issues are addressed before lower-priority cleanup.
- [ ] The plan prefers the smallest safe refactoring that resolves each confirmed issue.
- [ ] Required safety-net tests or validation steps are defined for each work item.
- [ ] Relevant `docs/wiki/` pages are updated to reflect delivered implementation, architecture, or testing changes.
- [ ] Affected wiki links resolve after documentation updates.
- [ ] Rollback/backout plan documented for each work item.
