# Systems Analysis Template

> Use this template to capture project-level systems analysis after `./docs/business-requirements.md` is drafted or approved and before creating any `./docs/00x-work/` work packages.
>
> This document refines business requirements into system boundary/context, key domain concepts, use cases, business rules, analysis-level requirements, and quality attributes. It must remain implementation-agnostic.

| Document | Path |

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Problem statement

<Concise restatement of the problem/opportunity and why this system exists.>

### 2.2 System boundary

| Item | In scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <capability/boundary item> | Yes/No | <notes> |

### 2.3 Key assumptions

- <assumption>

### 2.4 Architectural decisions (analysis-level)

Remove this section if not used.

Use `AD1`, `AD2`, ... for analysis-level architectural decisions.
These decisions capture system-level behavioral constraints and invariants that are expected to influence multiple work packages.
They must remain implementation-agnostic.

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Related UC IDs | Related SAR IDs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AD1 | <decision statement> | <why> | <UCx list> | <SARx list> | <optional> |

## 3. Context and External Interactions

### 3.1 Actors and external systems catalog

| ID | Name | Type (Actor/System) | Purpose | Information exchanged | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ES1 | <name> | <Actor/System> | <purpose> | <information> | <optional> |

### 3.2 Context diagram (optional)

Remove this section if not used.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["External actor"] --> S["System under analysis"]
  S --> X["External system"]
```

### 3.3 Interaction diagrams (optional)

Remove this section if not used.

Use this section to document analysis-level interactions for high-risk or high-ambiguity use cases.
Diagrams SHOULD focus on system boundary interactions and cross-cutting concerns (for example: authentication or session continuity, data freshness gating, request or confirmation traceability, approvals, and notifications).
Diagrams MUST remain implementation-agnostic (avoid internal component design and deployment topology).

```mermaid

  autonumber
  actor A as External actor
  participant S as System under analysis
  participant X as External system

  A->>S: <request/event>
  S->>X: <call>
  X-->>S: <response>
  S-->>A: <outcome>
```

## 4. Domain Concepts

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <entity> | <description> | <attributes> | <optional> |

## 5. User Journeys and Use Cases

Use `UC1`, `UC2`, ... for use cases.

## 6. Business Rules

Use `RULE1`, `RULE2`, ... for business rules.

| ID | Rule statement | Rationale | Related UC IDs | Related BR IDs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RULE1 | <rule> | <why> | <UCx list> | <BRx list> | <optional> |

## 7. Analysis-level Requirements

Use `SAR1`, `SAR2`, ... for system analysis requirements. These should be business-testable and describe what the system must do, without prescribing implementation.

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criteria (business-testable) | Related UC IDs | Related BR IDs | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SAR1 | <requirement> | <criteria> | <UCx list> | <BRx list> | <Must|Should|Could|Won't> | <optional> |

## 8. Quality Attributes (non-functional)

Use `NFR1`, `NFR2`, ... for quality attributes.

| ID | Category | Requirement | Target | How it will be assessed | Related BR IDs | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NFR1 | <Security/Performance/Availability/etc> | <requirement> | <target> | <assessment> | <BRx list> | <Must|Should|Could|Won't> | <optional> |
